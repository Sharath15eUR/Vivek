Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers to devices on a network.

The DHCP process follows four steps (DORA process):

Discovery – The client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER request to find a DHCP server.
Offer – The server responds with a DHCPOFFER containing an available IP address and other details.
Request – The client sends a DHCPREQUEST to accept the offered IP.
Acknowledge – The server confirms with a DHCPACK, and the client starts using the assigned IP.
