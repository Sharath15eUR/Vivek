Duplicate IP address in a network system generally causes IP conflict and disruptions in connectivity.

This may lead to the following issues :
a) Disrupted Communications - The destination may change as both use same IP.
b) Connectivity Loss - Based on the conflict, there occurs complete network access issues for either or for both of them.
c) Inability - It cannot access certain services on affected devices until the duplicate IP is resolved

This duplicate IP issue can be solved by proper DHCP configuration, double check while static IP assignment etc
