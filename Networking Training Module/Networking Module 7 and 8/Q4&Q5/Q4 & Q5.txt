1) VLAN

VLAN (Virtual LAN) is created on a group of devices/systems being connected to different physical LAN under a single LAN.

Many departments may have a single physical LAN and to differentiate among them they make use of VLAN. It allows them to segregate as a team even though connected in a same physical LAN or Different physical LAN.

To initialize VLAN in switches:
enable
config t
vlan 10
name Data_Vlan
exit

Assigning End Devices to VLAN:
interface FastEthernet0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
exit

These steps create a vlan and make the end devices configured to this vlan. If the switches are under same network then they can communicate through this itself. If they are in different vlan network then they will communicate after routing.

2) Trunk Ports
Trunk ports are used to assign a switch to communicate in multiple VLAN using VLAN Tagging. Using this a switch can be configured under many VLAN simultaneously.

To configure a switch as trunk port:
interface FastEthernet0/4
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan all
exit

show interfaces trunk -> This command will help us to verify the trunk port connectivity and it can be also verified using ping.
