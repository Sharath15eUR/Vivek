In Networking, When two subnets are connected using different routers, initially the communication fails as the routing table has not been updated. 

Updating routing table can be updated in two methods. 

One is through the configuration tab where it has a specific column for updating the network, mask and next hop.

Second method is using the CLI of the router. Here ip route command is used to update the routing in the router.

Syntax : ip route "subnet network id" "subnet Mask" "Next hop"

ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.2 ("used in my simulation)

The results were checked using tracert and ping commands.
