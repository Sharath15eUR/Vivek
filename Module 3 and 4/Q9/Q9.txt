Configuring a Basic LAN Interface Using the ip Command

Configuring a Local Area Network (LAN) interface in Linux involves assigning an IP address, bringing the interface up, and setting up a default gateway. Below are the step-by-step instructions:

Step 1: View Available Interfaces

	Run the following command to list all network interfaces:

	Command : ip link show

Step 2: Assign an IP Address

	Use the ip addr add command to assign an IP address and subnet mask to the interface:

	Command : sudo ip addr add 192.168.137.170/24 dev eth0

	This command assigns the IP address 192.168.137.170 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

Step 3: Bring the Interface Up

	Activate the interface using the ip link set command:

	Command : sudo ip link set eth0 up

Step 4: Add a Default Gateway

	Configure the default gateway to enable communication with other networks:

	Command : sudo ip route add default via 192.168.137.1


Step 5: Verify the Configuration

	Check the assigned IP address and routing table to ensure everything is configured correctly:

	Command : ip addr show eth0
		  ip route show
