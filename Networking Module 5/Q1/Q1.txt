ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is generally used when the device's IP Address is known but not its MAC or Physical Address.

To find out the physical address of the destination the ARP protocol is used by the source.

ARP consists of two types of packets - Request and Reply

Request packet is sent from the source which consists of the source IP, MAC and Destination IP Address. It has a empty filled padded with zeros at Destination MAC Address.

ARP Request is a broadcast message being sent from the source to all the nodes. The node which consists of the destination IP responds with ARP Reply.

ARP Reply packet consists of the IP & MAC Address of both, the source and the destination. It fills it's MAC Address in the source MAC Address of the Reply Packet.

ARP Reply is an unicast address as it knows the destination (the source from which the ARP request arrived).

The image in the folder consists of ARP Packets captured by Wireshark of my Home Wi-fi Router.

Since multiple devices are connected to Wi-fi it send multiple ARP request based on the application. We can see there are many broadcast messages being sent from the router. In that packet the destination MAC Address is filled with zeros.

When the laptop's IP Address is there in the destination then it responds with the ARP Reply Packet to the router thereby filling the laptop MAC address in the source physical address field.
