The ping command is used to check the connectivity of the device with the host.

While using DHCP the IP is assigned automatically by the DHCP Server based upon request from DHCP Client.

While using Static IP Assignment, the user has to provide the IP from the list of available IP's without providing same IP's to multiple devices.

In my home, I've assigned for the IP 192.168.29.18 and the connectivity is good and verified using ping.
