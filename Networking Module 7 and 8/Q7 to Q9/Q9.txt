If VLAN 10 cannot communicate with VLAN 20, we can check on this like

Issue				-	Troubleshooting Steps
VLANs assigned incorrectly	-	Use show vlan brief to check assignment
Trunk not allowing VLANs	-	Use show interfaces trunk, add missing VLANs
Native VLAN mismatch		-	Ensure both switches have same native VLAN
No inter-VLAN routing		-	Configure a router or Layer 3 switch


we can verify VLAN Membership by using the command "show vlan brief"

To check if the trunk is working, we can use the command "show interfaces trunk"

To test communication between VLANs, we can use "ping" command.

By these troubleshooting steps we can able to identify why vlan 10 cannot be able to communicate with vlan 20

If Vlan 10 and Vlan 20 are in different networks, then we need to carry out inter vlan routing.
