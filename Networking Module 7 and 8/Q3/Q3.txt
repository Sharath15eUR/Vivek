Traceroute command is used to identify the route from the client to the server (identifying the in between hops).

While checking with CISCO, we could find that cisco uses Akamai CDN for delivery and it has low latency.

Other method or alternative for traceroute is :

pathping - combines ping and traceroute command

tracert /4 - provides tracing with IPv4 addresses

tracert /6 - provides tracing with IPv6 addresses.
